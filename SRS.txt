Backend handles authentication, CRUD, payments, notifications, analytics.

Admin dashboard monitors and controls all entities.

5. Database Design (ER Diagram)

ER Diagram Description:

Entities: Users, Tutors, Classes, Enrollments, Reviews, Announcements, Promotions

Users (id, name, email, password, role, profile_pic)
    |
    | 1-to-1
    v
Tutors (user_id, bio, subjects, location, rating)
    |
    | 1-to-many
    v
Classes (id, tutor_id, title, description, subject, grade, location, schedule, price, promotion)
    |        |
    |        | 1-to-many

    |
    | 1-to-many
    v
Enrollments (id, class_id, student_id, enrolled_at)
    |
    v
Reviews (id, class_id, student_id, rating, review, created_at)

10. Testing Strategy

Unit tests for backend APIs using Jest or PyTest

Integration tests for API → Database interactions

Manual functional testing for mobile apps

Cross-device testing for iOS and Android

Push notification testing via Firebase console

11. Risk Management
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Payment failure for promotions	Medium	Stripe webhooks, retry logic, admin dashboard monitoring
Unauthorized access	High	JWT authentication, role-based access
Data loss	High	Daily database backups on Supabase
Push notification failure	Low	Firebase FCM monitoring, retry logic
Low tutor/student adoption	Medium	Marketing campaigns, app onboarding
